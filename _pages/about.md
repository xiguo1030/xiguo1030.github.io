My name is Xiaorang Guo. I’m a first-year PhD student in Department of Informatics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My advisor is Prof. Dr. Martin Schulz. I have received my bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering, from Harbin Institute of Technology and Technische Universität Dresden, respectively.

I am interested in digital circuit design and quantum computing. Currently, I’m focusing on designing a quantum control processor based on the FPGA board. My ultimate goal is to provide a scalable instruction set and architectural design of the quantum control processor for various physical platforms such as superconducting qubits, neutral atoms, and ion traps.

Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in joining the lab for research opportunities!
