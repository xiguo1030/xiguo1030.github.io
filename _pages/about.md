My name is Xiaorang Guo. I’m a first-year PhD student in Department of Informatics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My advisor is Prof. Dr. Martin Schulz. I have received my bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering, from Harbin Institute of Technology and Technische Universität Dresden, respectively.

I am interested in digital circuit design and quantum computing. Currently, I’m focusing on designing a quantum control processor based on the FPGA board. My ultimate goal is to provide a scalable instruction set and architectural design of the quantum control processor for various physical platforms such as superconducting qubits, neutral atoms, and ion traps.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
